Skyflo.ai is your AI co-pilot for Cloud & DevOps that unifies Kubernetes operations and CI/CD systems (starting with Jenkins) through natural language with a safety-first, human-in-the-loop design.

## How to Install

Skyflo.ai offers flexible deployment options, accommodating both production and local Kubernetes environments:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skyflo-ai/skyflo/main/deployment/install.sh -o install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

Skyflo can be configured to use different LLM providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, etc.), or even use a self-hosted model.

For more details, see the [Installation Guide](docs/install.md).

## Supported Tools

Skyflo.ai executes Cloud & DevOps operations through standardized tools and integrations:

* **Kubernetes**: Resource discovery; get/describe; logs/exec; **safe apply/diff** flows.
* **Argo Rollouts**: Inspect status; pause/resume; promote/cancel; analyze progressive delivery.
* **Helm**: Search, install/upgrade/rollback with dry-run and diff-first safety.
* **Jenkins (new)**: Jobs, builds, logs, SCM, identityâ€”**secure auth & CSRF handling**, integration-aware tool filtering, and automatic parameter injection from configured credentials.

Write/mutating operations require explicit approval from the user.
